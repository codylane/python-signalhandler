class SignalHandler:
    '''             
    This class is used to handle and trap a signal and associate
    it back to a python callable object. When a new SignalHandler
    object is created you must call the register() method to register
    the signal and callback.  See register() for details.            

    This superclass has an abstract method called 'handler' which
    should be defined in a sub-class.                            

    This class is a super class for SigAction. SigAction is the 
    class that performs the signal event handling.              
    '''

        Registers a new signal handler action object (SigAction) 
        for trapping a signal and then calling a python object.  

        When this method is called it also updates the static SIGNALS
        tuple appending the new SigAction class.  To get this tuple  
        see getActions().

                  will be called when the callback is initialized..
